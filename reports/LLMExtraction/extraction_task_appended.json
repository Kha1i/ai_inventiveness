        "description": "A car trailer manufacturer aims to increase the payload capacity of their flatbed trailers. By using high-strength steel in the frame construction, they have successfully increased the maximum load by 20%. The new design, while more capable, has resulted in a 15% increase in overall trailer weight. This additional weight reduces fuel efficiency for the towing vehicle and may require drivers to upgrade to more powerful tow vehicles for maximum capacity loads.",
